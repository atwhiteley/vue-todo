# Vue workshop todo final result

This is the app we ended up with at the end of the workshop. I decided to add one more stand alone list component that has the exact same template and functionality, but uses props & emits events to signal state change instead of using VueX. This is useful to have a look at on how to create composable components that can be reused, that do not mutate state themselves.

Note that this was a live coding session, and the final result is not meant to be a perfectly coded implementation. 

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

## To run locally
